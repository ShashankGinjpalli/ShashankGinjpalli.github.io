                        The problem is that companies like Uber rely on human drivers to get places and the cars arent actually owned by Uber.
                        This causes problems because of ride cancellations and using Uber would become alot safer without human drivers. We
                        simulated the streets of a city using a maze. The car has to traverse through the maze find the passenger, and bring the passenger
                        to the starting location of maze.

                        Our solution to get through the maze and complete the objective was this robot that had an ultrasound sensor on the front of it to see the 
                        walls. Rather than going with the more traditional stick to a wall and follow it method we created an algorithm to map the walls of the maze 
                        and route a path to get to the ending destination

                        The algorithm that we used instead to get the robot to the end position was to always try to face the robot in the direction of the end point.
                        When the robot would see a wall then it would move to the next grid point until it could not move over any more. Once it picks up the passenger then it uses the same pathfinding algorithm to go back to the starting location and drop them off

                        Obviously an actual street has many more factors that our simulated maze and this algorithm would not work in an actual city environment but using this project we have shown that if those factors are accounted for, self driving ridesharing services are entirely possible. Furthermore, execution speed could be pretty much realtime using an actual computer and not a small arm processor to process the path finding. Some things that we had trouble with was tuning the motors to drive in sync so that we could get the robot to drive in a straight line. We solved this problem by putting a crashbar on the back and backing the robot into the nearest wall so that it would straighten the robot out.
